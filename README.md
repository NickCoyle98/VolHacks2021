  This is a repository for VolHacks2021 Project. The project that I decided to make was a take on an alarm system. The board that we were given is the Grove Beginner Kit for Adruino. There are not a lot of sensors to work with in this kit, but we can make use of the sensors with software. This will be done by implementing a security system. This security system will have a couple main features.\
  Those Features are:\
      - Inputing a password.\
      - Using OLED Display to tell the user whether the system is armed.\
      - Using the LED to indicate the arm status of the system (ON armed, OFF not armed).\
      - Using the Microphone to detect loud crashes
      - Using the buzzer as an alarm if the system detects a person when the system is armed or too many incorrect passwords.\
  The softwares that will be used to achieve this are:\
      - Arduino IDE\
  The Adruino IDE will be used to develop the driving code for the Adruino and its sensors.
